# AlumniConnect – SuperHR Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

**AlumniConnect (SuperHR)** is an internal HR management platform designed to help the HR team maintain structured engagement with former staff members (ex-professors, TAs, and employees). The system enables centralized communication, alumni management, event coordination, and data-driven engagement through analytics and AI-based recommendations.

The platform is exclusively for HR use. Former employees do not access the system directly and receive communication only via Email and WhatsApp.
